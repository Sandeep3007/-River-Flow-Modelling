## River Flow Modelling using LSTM

### Overview
This project focuses on leveraging deep learning techniques, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, to predict river flow in the Kolar sub-basin of the Narmada basin in central India. Accurate river flow predictions are crucial for various sectors including hydrology, agriculture, and water management.

### Motivation
The critical need for accurate river flow predictions prompted the development of this project. By utilizing LSTM networks, which excel at capturing long-term dependencies in sequential data, we aimed to improve the accuracy of river flow forecasting.

### Methodology
- **Data Collection:** Rainfall and evaporation data for the Kolar sub-basin were collected.
- **Preprocessing:** Data preprocessing involved handling missing values, scaling, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
- **Model Architecture:** An LSTM neural network architecture was designed, consisting of one LSTM layer with four memory cells followed by a Dense layer.
- **Training:** The model was trained on historical data using libraries such as numpy, pandas, and scikit-learn.
- **Evaluation:** The performance of the model was evaluated using Matplotlib for visualization of actual versus predicted river flow values, and the R-squared score was calculated to quantify the model's accuracy.

### Key Libraries Used
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

### Results
The LSTM model demonstrated promising results in predicting river flow values, showcasing its potential for accurate time series predictions.

### Conclusion
